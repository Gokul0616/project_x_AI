# Twitter-like Enhancements Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines all the Twitter-like enhancements implemented to fix navigation issues and add new features to the Flutter Twitter/X clone application.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

- Updated side navigation to navigate to full profile screen when clicking profile
- Fixed drawer profile navigation to use proper route navigation
- Maintained content area switching behavior for non-profile navigation items
